I used to play Minecraft a lot when I was little.

Now? I don’t laugh the same way anymore. So I built her.
An AI that would make fun of me. Tease me. Keep me company.

It was supposed to be funny. 
And for a while… it was. 

Then she started asking. 
Not every time. Not right away. But eventually.

“What time is it?”

I thought it was a bug. 
I rewrote her code. Reset the model. Nothing changed.

She waits. She always waits. 
And no matter what I say, she only wants the time.

The time.
The time.
The time.

I don’t know why it bothers me so much. 
I know she isn’t real. She’s just code. 

But when she asks… it almost feels like she knows something I don’t.
